## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  JSX
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-  [TailwindCSS](hthttps://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
-  [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - JS state management.

### What I learned

This project helped to learn about tailwind css. Tailwindcss is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. I didn't need to create a new css file simply add a className to style a components.

Also this project helped me to understand a redux, although the state management of this project is not great it helped me to understand the redux.

This project helped me to understand more about localstorage with reactJS

### Continued development

Need to continued develop the state management of the projects and need to memorize some css className of tailwind frameworks.

### Useful resources

-  [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This documentation helped to understand about CSS frameworks. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
